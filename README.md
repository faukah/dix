# Diff Nix

A blazingly fast tool to diff Nix related things.

Currently only supports closures (a derivation graph, such as a system build or
package).

![output of `dix /nix/var/nix/profiles/system-69-link/ /run/current-system`](.github/dix.png)

## Usage
```bash
$ dix --help
Diff Nix

Usage: dix [OPTIONS] <OLD_PATH> <NEW_PATH>

Arguments:
  <OLD_PATH>


  <NEW_PATH>


Options:
  -v, --verbose...
          Increase logging verbosity

  -q, --quiet...
          Decrease logging verbosity

      --color <WHEN>
          Controls when to use color

          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, always, never]

      --force-correctness
          Fall back to a backend that is focused solely on absolutely guaranteeing correct results at the cost of memory usage and query speed.

          This is relevant if the output of dix is to be used for more critical applications and not just as human-readable overview.

          In the vast, vast majority of cases, the default backend should be sufficient.

      --output <OUTPUT>
          Select the output format to use

          Possible values:
          - human: Output in the default dix format highlighting version changes
          - json:  Display the output as JSON for machine parsing (requires `json` feature)

          [default: human]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version

$ dix /nix/var/profiles/system-69-link /run/current-system
```

# Usage in CI

If you're planning on using dix in CI, you might want to set the
`--force-correctness` flag to ensure that the results are definitely accurate.\
Dix will fall back to a connection using `?immutable=1` to Nix's SQLite database
if it fails connecting normally; This can however result in inaccurate output if
the database is being written to at the same time.\
Passing `--force-correctness` will make dix fall back to Nix commands if
connection to the database fails, which ensures correct output, potentially at
the cost of speed.

## Thanks

Huge thanks to [nvd](https://git.sr.ht/~khumba/nvd) for the original idea! Dix
is heavily inspired by this and basically just a "Rewrite it in Rust" version of
nvd, with a few things like version diffing done better.

Furthermore, many thanks to the amazing people who made this projects possible
by contributing code and offering advice:

- [@Dragyx](https://github.com/Dragyx) - Cool SQL queries. Much of dix's speed
  is thanks to him.
- [@NotAShelf](https://github.com/NotAShelf) - Implementing proper error
  handling.
- [@RGBCube](https://github.com/RGBCube) - Giving the codebase a deep scrub.
